# Maximilien Lentschener

**Senior Full-Stack Developer** · Paris, France

10+ years building web platforms, from MVPs to enterprise-grade systems. Started my career managing a 3,000-player gaming community as a teenager — turns out herding gamers is excellent prep for herding microservices.

I care about clean architecture, performance, and shipping things that actually work. My cat Iggy cares about none of this and will scream for 2 hours straight if dinner is 5 minutes late.

## What I bring to the table

- **Architecture & Industrialization** — Shared codebases across platforms (React + React Native), scalable white-label solutions, development standards that teams can actually follow. I've written more documentation than my cat has ignored me.

- **Performance** — Hunting down N+1 queries, refactoring legacy code, making slow apps fast. The kind of work that makes DBAs buy you coffee.

- **Security** — Enterprise-grade authentication (SSO, SAML, OAuth) for clients like AXA, Richemont, Cartier. Turns out luxury brands are very particular about who gets in.

- **Monitoring** — Building dashboards that give ops teams real visibility into infrastructure. Because "it works on my machine" doesn't scale to thousands of servers.
